The aim of the game is to try to reach the furthest 
distance possible while trying to dodge other cars 
on the three-lane motorway. Think smart and anticipate 
what lane to switch to next because if you collide 
with another vehicle the game ends.

Use the right mouse button to click buttons, such as, 
‘Start the Game’. Use the arrow keys, which are located 
on the right hand side of the keyboard, to switch lanes 
when the game has started.
